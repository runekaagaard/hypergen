Use @liveview to make the view become alive. It does the following:

- Sets up a url for the view.
- Monitors usage of models (view, create, etc.), and throws an exception if the user does not have
  the required permissions.
- If "mutates" is true starts a transaction.
- Hook up callback functions to the frontend.
- If "autosave" is true, automatically changes fields changed in the frontend.

To further remove boilerplate, you can add a django object directly in the url. The url should
persist of the objects primary key, and the view will be passed an instance of that object.
